# MCAL
MCAL is a python program that uses the pseudo equivalent widths (PEWs) of high-resolution spectral lines from the HARPS spectrograph to infer temperatures and metallicities of M-dwarf stars.

From the results of MCAL a paper was written and published in Astronomy and Astrophysics magazine - https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013A%26A...551A..36N/abstract
